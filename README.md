# VRMLGo

VRMLGo is a [Go](https://golang.org/) package that provides low level
bindings to the [VR Master League](https://vrmasterleague.com/) client API.

It closely follows the implementation/patterns of
[DiscordGo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo).

This is a work in progress and is not yet feature complete. Most endpoints
have not been implemented yet. Please file an issue if you would like to see
to see a specific endpoint implemented (or send a PR).
